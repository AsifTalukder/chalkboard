#### Apurbo Das

I mostly tried to contribute on the site map. I also did the mobile version of wireframe and half of desktop version wireframe.
Basically I learned how to plan out a site before starting with any coding at all. Now when I look at my wireframe and site map, I get better idea of exactly what to do.

#### Asif Talukder

I contributed to the wireframe and the sitemap of instructors portal. From this assignment I have learnt how to progress gradually started from minimal requirements and structure a website before get starts to coding.
