## Used platforms for the Final Deliverable
- MongoDB as database
- Mongoose for quering
- bcrypt for password hashing (We are giving plain password but database keeps as hashed)
- Node.js and Express.js(node.js framework) used for backend
- HTML, CSS and bootstrap used for front backend
- Website hosted on Heroku

## The task have done for D3

- We used MongoDB for our database
- we implement the sign-up, sign-in and sign-out using Node.js
- We hosted our website on Heroku
- We add the admin portal that we missed to add in our past deliverable
- we pust some user data in our database
- Only the admin can retrive the database from the admin portal
- username should be unique for every user
